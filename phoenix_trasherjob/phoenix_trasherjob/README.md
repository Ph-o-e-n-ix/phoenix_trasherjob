You can empty Trashcans with your Garbage Truck and set own coords if you want.

You can also setup more coords to start the Job

Theres also a Bonus each 10th Trashcan you empty. You get also an amount of money each trashcan
(Also configurable in Config)

There are also a Webhook. This was for my Usage, but i dont wanted to delete. So you can decide if you want to use it

There are some Trashcan props. You can set the visibility local or visible for all players. The Trashcanprop will be deletet after a few seconds ur finished the trashcan.

You can also add your own vehicle in the Config so every Car is aviable.
